}
\arguments{

\item{outname}{(Optional) String that is prepended to filenames.}

\description{
Outputs results from varimpact() into three Latex tables: consistent results,
all results, and per-fold results.
}
\details{
Creates three Latex table files:
 \itemize{
   \item varimpConsistent.tex - the ``consistent'' significant results, meaning those with consistent categories chosen as comparison groups among factors and consistent ordering for numeric variables.
   \item varimpAll.tex - the file with cross-validated average variable impacts ordered by statistical significance.
   \item varimpByV.tex - the comparison levels used within each validation sample.  Either integer ordering of factors or short-hand for percentile cut-off (0-1 is the 10th percentile, 10+ is the 100th percentile)
}
